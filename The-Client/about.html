    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Second Chance Animal Rescue was founded by Jane Dowe in 2019. We are a no kill animal shelter and have two locations in Wisconsin; in the cities of Eau Claire and Milwaukee, but we routinely partner with other shelters and organization outside this area. </p>
    <p> Our focus is on all animals, as everyone deserves a second chance at a forever home no matter their shape or size. We pride ourselves on never turning away an animal in need, no matter the circumstances it may be in. All animals deserve to be loved. We fully believe that, and are working to achieve that goal one adoption at a time. </p>
